# Import Posts from other platforms into WordPress

1. Enter your site URL
2. Select a spreadsheet with the following columns: `slug`, `title`, `date`, and `content`
3. Authenticate as a user of that site
4. Begin uploading

### Roadmap

- Failed uploads don't complain. You'll notice an empty space where they print out at the end, but obviously this needs to change.
- There's no way to control what part of the spreadsheet gets sent, and it requires specific column titles.
